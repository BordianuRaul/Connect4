I designed and implemented a Connect 4 game using Python and the Pygame library for the user interface. To provide a challenging gameplay experience, I incorporated the minimax algorithm with alpha beta pruning to generate computer moves. This involved creating a game tree to evaluate all possible moves and selecting the move that maximized the computer's chances of winning. I also added a simple scoring system to prioritize certain moves over others. One of the biggest challenges was optimizing the algorithm to run efficiently while still providing a strong gameplay experience.
